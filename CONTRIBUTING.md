## Got a question or problem?

Firstly, please go over our FAQ: https://github.com/vijaytanwar/ngAppBootstrapper/wiki/FAQ

Please, do not open issues for the general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests.

StackOverflow is a much better place to ask questions since:
* there are hundreds of people willing to help on StackOverflow
* questions and answers stay available for public viewing so your question / answer might help someone else
* SO voting system assures that the best answers are prominently visible.

To save your and our time we will be systematically closing all the issues that are requests for general support and redirecting people to StackOverflow.

## You think you've found a bug?

Oh, we are ashamed and want to fix it asap! But before fixing a bug we need to reproduce and confirm it. In order to reproduce bugs we will systematically ask you to provide a _minimal_ reproduce scenario using http://plnkr.co/. Having a live reproduce scenario gives us wealth of important information without going back & forth to you with additional questions like:
* version of AngularJS used
* version of this library that you are using
* 3rd-party libraries used, if any
* and most importantly - a use-case that fails

## You want to contribute some code?

We are always looking for the quality contributions and will be happy to accept your Pull Requests as long as those adhere to some basic rules:

* Please make sure that your contribution fits well in the project's context:
  * we are aiming at improve on existing features.
  * Currenlty JSLint is there but it does not do that good job, as configuration needs to be enhanced.
  * Apart from this we are aiming to provide the utilities which require very less effort for making multilingual sites while keep existing functionality intact.
* Please assure that you are submitting quality code, specifically make sure that:
  *Please run the JSlint before submitting your code.
  *Please make sure your code does not break any existing features.
